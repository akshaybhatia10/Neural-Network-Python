# Neural Network Python - Bike Sharing Prediction
## Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation 

### Install

This project requires **Python 3** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory  (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook dlnd-your-first-neural-network.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook dlnd-your-first-neural-network.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.

## About

In this project, we will build a first neural network from scratch in numpy and use it to predict daily bike rental ridership.
